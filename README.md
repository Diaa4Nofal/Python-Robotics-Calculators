# Robotics Engineering Calculators 🤖

This repository contains a collection of Python-based tools designed to solve common engineering problems in robotics and automation.

## 🚀 Featured Tool: Motor Efficiency Calculator
The first tool in this suite calculates the efficiency of a robotic motor by comparing input power to actual output power.

### ⚙️ How it works:
* **Input:** Power delivered to the motor (Watts).
* **Output:** Actual power utilized (Watts).
* **Formula:** Efficiency = (Output Power / Input Power) * 100
